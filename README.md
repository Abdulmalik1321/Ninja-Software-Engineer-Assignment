# Ninja-Software-Engineer-Assignment

This repo is an attempt to solve The Ninja Software Engineer Assignment:

Write a program in your favorite programming language or framework. The program should:

- Push a list of user information to custom segments in Snapchatâ€™s ad platform.
- Store randomly generated user information in text format or a local database and read it during execution.
- Allow the operator to add all information possible for each user.
- Update or refresh information if the segments already exist.
- Be easily extendable to push more segments by defining them (in text or database).
- Use local Git and push to GitHub with meaningful commits. Try to commit often to show clear development progress.
- Include open source packages if needed, but the main program should be written by you.
